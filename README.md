- Displays rating, description, # of players, genre, publish date & last played metadata on detailed and video views

## General Usage
Shell script to manage your RetroPie installation, using this RetroDos script as the 'graphical' front end.

To run the RetroDos script make sure that your APT repositories are up-to-date and that Git is installed:

``` bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get install git
```

Then you can download the latest RetroPie setup script with:

``` bash
cd
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ofpinewood/retro-dos.git
```

The script is executed with:

``` bash
cd retro-dos
sudo ./retrodos.sh
```

When you first run the script it may install some additional packages that are needed.

> NOTE: When you get `command not found` when executing the script you might be missing the execute permissions on the script files (`*.sh`).
> ``` bash
> cd retro-dos
> find . -type f -iname "*.sh" -exec chmod u+x {} \;
> ```
> `-type f`: Normal files only (skip directories, symlinks, named pipes and sockets, and the special files found in /dev)
> `-iname`: Ignore case in the name
> `"*.sh"`: Globbing, telling the `find` command to search for files with ".sh" extension
> `-exec chmod +x {}`: This tells the `find` command to carry out a `chmod` command on each found file. Making each executable
> `\;:` Indicating end of command
